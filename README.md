# Projects

A collection of personal projects built in **C** and **Python** to practice and improve my programming and problem-solving skills. 

This repository includes small-to-medium projects that explore different programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Itâ€™s meant both as a learning tool and as a showcase of my coding abilities.

## How to compile and run C programs

For single-file programs:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program
./program
