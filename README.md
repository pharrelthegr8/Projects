# Projects

A collection of personal projects built in **C** and **Python** to practice and improve my programming and problem-solving skills. 

This repository includes small-to-medium projects that explore different programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. It’s meant both as a learning tool and as a showcase of my coding abilities.
